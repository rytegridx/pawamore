          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Nigeria has some of the most driven, creative, and resilient people on earth. Every day, those people — entrepreneurs, parents, students, professionals — are fighting an energy system that was never built for them.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-4">
            We started PawaMore Systems because we got tired of watching Nigerians spend billions every year on generator fuel, breathing fumes, losing businesses, and living on NEPA's unpredictable schedule.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            PawaMore Systems is not a product shop. It is a <strong>systems integrator</strong> — we design, supply, install, and support complete energy solutions that change how our customers live and work. Every single day.
